Modeling scope:
    A watershed with a single basin outlet.
    Semi-distributed model (not grid).


About agents:
We have three agent APIs:
(1) InsituAgentTypes: Directly divert/add water from subbasin before routing.
(2) RiverDivAgents: Add water to outlets before routing or divert water from
    outlets after routing.
(3) DamAgents : Complete redefine instream water after upstream routing.
(4) ConveyAgent : Directly convey water from one node to another.

Here we define an agent as an actor which associates with a unique name and 
setting dict in the model.yaml. Each agent belong to one agent type and one 
decision-making class (DMClass). An agent type is a user-defined class followed
by a basic structure defined below:

Class AgType():
    def __init__(self, Name, Config, StartDate, DataLength):
        # Initialization
        pass
    def act(self, Q, AgentDict, node, CurrentDate, t, DM):
        # Action when agent is called at every HydroCNHS simulation time step 
        # (day). This is not the decision-making (DM) step. When to exercute DM
        # will need to be explicilty defined here. 
        return self.Q

As mentioned above each agent will be assigned with a DMClass, which has 
its structure defined below:

class DMClass():
    def __init__(self, StartDate, DataLength, ABM):
        # Initialization
        pass
    def __call__(self, Q, t, CurrentDate, ag, Output, AssignValue = False):
        # Double-check whether to run DMFunc, especially for group agents,
        # which they make their desicions together. Therfore, their DMFunc only
        # need to be exercuted once in a simulation (decision) time step.
        return Output
    def DMFunc(self):
        # Main decision-making function.
        pass

The second layer of the ABM is so-called agent group. Agents belong to a group
will be exercute together. Namely, the unique group name will be use as a call
name in the HydroCNHS. Therefore, the agent group agent type should contain a 
for loop to go over each within-group agent. The group infomation is defined in
Inputs under ABM settings.

In some cases, we need to have a jointly operated reservoirs, which means we 
need those reservoirs' upstream routing to be done. Namely, we need to ensure 
the routing outlets' simulation order is correct. Therefore, the grouped dam
-type agent type will be automatically detected and reorder the sorted 
simulation sequence.

To do==========================================================================
Need to rethink the DMClass logic or explanation
Test run
Function documentation
test function
User guide
Technical report
default_config()
plot_equifinal()
get_equifinal_models()
model_builder
ga_deap to let user be able to change deap setup.

Done list======================================================================
Test sim sequence: Make sure your back tracking is workable for cross sub basin
                   but same human group.
Test DEAP
Turn to three apis
Rename YAML => Attributes
Correct all naming issues and code style.
Move load module ahead of LSM simulation

Maybe initiate data collector
