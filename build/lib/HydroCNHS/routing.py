# Inputs
#  FlowLen = [m] Travel distence of flow between two outlets.

# Parameters
#  RoutePars["GShape"] = Sub-basin's UH shape parameter (Gamma distribution argument) (N)
#  RoutePars["GRate"] = Sub-basin's UH rate parameter (reservior storage constant)  (K)
#  RoutePars["Velo"]  = [m/s] Diffusion wave celerity in the linearized Saint-Venant equation   
#  RoutePars["Diff"]  = [m2/s] Diffusive coefficient in the linearized Saint-Venant equation

# Note:
# We fix the Base Time setting here. For future development, it is better to
# turn entire Lohmann routing into a class with Base Time setting as attributes
# which allow to be changed accordingly.
