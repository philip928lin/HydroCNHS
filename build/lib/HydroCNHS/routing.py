import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import gamma

# Inputs
#  FlowLength = [m] Travel distence of flow between two outlets.
#  InstreamControl = [bool] Instream control (e.g., dams).
# Parameters
#  GShape = Subbasin's UH shape parameter (gamma function).
#  GScale = Subbasin's UH scale parameter (gamma function).
#  Velo  = [m/s] Diffusion wave celerity in the linearized Saint-Venant equation.
#  Diff  = [m2/s] Diffusive coefficient in the linearized Saint-Venant equation.

# Note:
# We fix the base time setting here. For future development, it is better to
# turn entire Lohmann routing into a class with base time setting as attributes
# which allow to be changed accordingly.
