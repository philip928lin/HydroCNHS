HydroCNHS User Manual
=====================================

**The Hydrological model for Coupled Natural-Human Systems (HydroCNHS)** is an open-source Python package supporting four Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that enable users to integrate their human decision models, which can be programmed with the agent-based modeling (ABM) concept, into the HydroCNHS.

Manual contributors: Chung-Yi Lin & Ali Ghaffari
